((this has all the examples datamodelling questions of the Certification exam.))


- PK is how the data will be distributed (data distribution) - aka node locality.

- PrimaryKEY defines data uniqueness

- Partition Keys affects partition sizes

- Clustering Key defines ordering with an PARTITION .. (not a TABLE) - Important 

- COUNTER columns CANNOT be inserted and have a start value , they can only be incremented or decremented. start value is 0 as it is an INT.

- STATIC columns - all the Rows in the same partition will share the SAME static Column Value. 

- STATIC COLOUMS ONLY to be on NON CLUSTERING COLUMNS . Hence no static possible on partition key or clustering columns. 



- when there is only ONE PartitionKey , 
		- all the rows of the table will be in a SINGLE PARTITION . this is called single Row 
 		partition 

- in composite partition key , there will be MULTI ROW Partitions , as the data will be distributed based on the combiniation of the columns of the partition key.

- in where clause PARTITION key allows Equality Predicate . 

- Clustering column is part of the where clause , we can use range ( > , <  etc) , (ie inequality predicate).

-  WHERE clause NOT Allowed  on STATIC Columns 

Key Modelling steps 
	 - conceptual data model - understand the data
	 		- this models the entities, the Relationships (1:n, 1:1 etc), possibly field types for a attribute being a UDT / Collection etc. 

	 - application workflow - identify access patterns
	 	- shows the flow of the application from a user point of view. 
	 		- show all the Networks 
	 			- next choose one network from the above and show all the sensors order by sensorname
	 				- choose 1 Sensor from the list 
	 					- display details of that sensor (latitude/longtitude/ heat etc )

	 - logical data model - query first approach 
	 		- this is the actual ERD diagram which shows the tables in C* as identified by the application workflow.

	 - physical data model - optimize and implement. 












- create index , create custom index
