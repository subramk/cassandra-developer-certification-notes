Cassandra Developer Certification  Datastax Preparation tips and guidance

I took the 8 week Cassandra Developer Workshop programme offered by the kind folks of Datastax and as part of the learning of watching the videos 
and doing the quizzes, exercises etc I had taken notes . 

I am sharing these up here , so that it can useful later for myself as well as others. 

The following links were very useful in the preparation :

- Mandatory courses for the Developer Path found in the  ( https://academy.datastax.com ) . Please ensure you answer all quizzes are done and fully understood from the DS101,DS210,DS220. 

- All the Labs from Katacoda - https://katacoda.com/datastax/courses/cassandra-intro/  - Would be very useful to understand all the core concepts fully. 

- Sample Certification Questions from Datastax and solutions  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NSUXcWrkZM&t=5532s 

- Data Modelling in C* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVeqscjInhI - All  questions on the Chekboto Diagrams in the exam come ONLY rom the Messaging Model and Sensor Network Model discussed in the video .
