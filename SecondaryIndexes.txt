Secondary indexes

- Secondary indexs are stored on each node in a cluster ... so a query involving a index could 
easily becoming a performance bottleneck . 

- Always try to index a column with low cardinality of few values. 

- COUNTER column cannot be used in creating index.

- CLUSTERING column CAN be used in creating a index. 

- Indexes may be created aon MULTIPLE Columns but should have ONE  create index statement for each column . ( important )

- SASI index must have the OPTIONS Keyword on it .
